LCD breakout board

Trying to create a breakout board.

Connect STM32F103CBT [Maple mini](https://github.com/leaflabs/maplemini), Texas Instruments [Stellaris Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-lm4f120xl)
to some LCD/LED displays. Hitachi HD44780 - 16x02 or 20x04 text displays, graphics TN display 128x64 (this board designed for my spare Bolymin BG12864DBNHH)
and 7-segment TM1638 displays.

Power jack for 12V power, two voltage regulators +3.3V and 5V, plus boards have their own.

Two headers to access all pins of Maple mini.
